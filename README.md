# Firstly
I delved deeply into Large Language Models, acquiring expertise that I applied to develop a full-stack, LLM-based software.<br>
This tool empowers researchers to efficiently extract precise answers from extensive scientific literature, revolutionizing information retrieval with an efficiency improvement of ten to a hundredfold compared to traditional methods.
- applied retrieval augmented generation
- built an advanced retrieval system (query rewrite, small-to-big retrieval, reciprocal rerank, etc..)
- quantitative evaluation, answer accuracy > 90 % (0 shot GPT4 has an accuracy of 65 %)
- experimented with building Agents (ReAct, OpenAI assistant API)
- build a frontend with Streamlit

# Second
I enhanced our company's Bayesian optimization algorithm through a data-centric approach, modularizing it into an industry-standard framework and implementing an adaptive learning framework for continuous model improvement.
- Intensive data ingestion and cleaning
- models evaluation
- active learning loop

# Hands-on professional experience:

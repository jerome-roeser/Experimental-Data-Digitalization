The integration of artiﬁcial intelligence into scientiﬁc research opens new avenues with the advent of GPT-
4V, a large language model equipped with vision capabilities. In this study, we demonstrate that GPT-4V,
accessible through the ChatGPT web user interface or an API, oﬀers promising possibilities in navigating
and mining complex data for metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) especially from graphical sources (e.g.
sorption isotherms, powder X-ray diﬀraction patterns, thermogravimetric analysis graphs, etc.). Our
approach involved an automated process of converting 346 scholarly articles into 6240 images, which
represents a benchmark dataset in this task, followed by deploying GPT-4V to categorize and analyze
these images using natural language prompts, which can be written by chemists or materials scientists
with minimal prior coding knowledge. This methodology enabled GPT-4V to accurately identify and
interpret key plots integral to MOF characterization, such as nitrogen isotherms, PXRD patterns, and TGA
curves, among others, with accuracy and recall above 93%. The model's proﬁciency in extracting critical
information from these plots not only underscores its capability in data mining but also highlights its
potential to aid in the digitalization of experimental data and the creation of datasets for reticular
chemistry. In addition, the trends and values of nitrogen isotherm data from the selected literature
allowed for a comparison between theoretical and experimental porosity values for over 200
compounds,
highlighting
certain
discrepancies
and
underscoring
the
importance
of
integrating
computational and experimental data. This work highlights the potential of AI in accelerating scientiﬁc
discovery by bridging the gap between computational tools and experimental research.
Introduction
The integration of articial intelligence (AI) with the chemical
sciences holds immense potential, and is accelerated by the rise
of large language models (LLMs).1–7 These models have received
substantial attention for the fact that they can be intuitively
“programmed” or “taught” using daily conversational language,
thereby assisting with diverse chemistry research tasks.8–20 It is
envisioned that the evolution from text-only to more dynamic,
multi-modal LLMs will result in even more powerful and
convenient AI assistants across various applications.5,21–23
The recent introduction of GPT-4V, with ‘V’ denoting its
vision capability, stands as a testament to this progress.21,24
Trained on a vast and varied collection of multi-modal data,
GPT-4V can process and respond to both textual and visual
inputs.24–27 Its ability to interpret and analyze scientic litera-
ture, especially in identifying valuable data within graphical
representations, makes it more attractive than traditional text-
only models in natural language processing (NLP).10,28–30 These
novel capabilities allow researchers from diverse backgrounds,
including those with no specialized coding or computer vision
expertise, to harness the power of GPT-4V through customized
instructions applicable to various areas.19,31–33

Herein, we report the applications of GPT-4V in the eld of
reticular chemistry.34,35 We demonstrate how GPT-4V can
seamlessly interpret and integrate complex data from both
textual and graphical sources in the scientic literature (Fig. 1).
This ability to extract and analyze critical information from
various gures and plots dramatically increases the model's
utility in data mining and information retrieval. In particular,
distilling physical characterization results from graphical
content reported in papers can be pivotal in establishing the
collection of experimental data and guiding the discovery of
new chemical compounds.34,36–39 Moreover, this methodology,
while demonstrated in the context of reticular chemistry, has
the potential to be generalized to other scientic disciplines for
automated literature reading. This development underscores

The content of these ﬁgures is based on actual experimental data, extracted and replotted from earlier publications to accurately reﬂect the plot
shapes for demonstration of the workﬂow. GPT-4V identiﬁes features based on the described target plots, and the classiﬁcation responses,
which may include single or multiple labels, are compiled. These responses are associated with the DOI and corresponding page number of the
paper, facilitating eﬃcient data retrieval from the targeted pages.

the expanding role of AI in fostering innovation and discovery,
which will further bridge the gap between advanced computa-
tional tools and cutting-edge chemical research.40,41
Methods
Data preparation
For this study, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6240 pages
from 346 scholarly articles published in 22 peer-reviewed jour-
nals among 5 diﬀerent publishers discussing metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) was meticulously curated from the CoRE
MOF Database (2019)42 to ensure the diversity of writing styles,
article formatting and page layout. The selection criteria
focused on excluding papers reporting structures with zero
accessible surface areas and those without publicly available
DOI numbers. In this case, the criteria resulted in the selection
of 346 downloadable articles which met the specied require-
ments on the accessible surface area from the 9147 papers listed
in the CoRE MOF database. The selected PDFs were trans-
formed into PNG format utilizing a Python script developed
with the assistance of ChatGPT (ESI Fig. S16†). This conversion
process included 4423 pages from the main text and 1817 pages
from the ESI of those chosen papers (ESI Data Set).†
Prompts and image mining considerations
We wrote instructions in natural language to guide GPT-4V for
image classication and analysis. The primary objective was to
enable GPT-4V to categorize each image with a label reecting
its content. These labels were designed to represent the most
prevalent types of plots encountered in reticular chemistry,
encompassing essential data and values. Key plots include the
nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm (indicating porosity),
the PXRD pattern (illustrating crystallinity), the TGA curve
(demonstrating thermal stability), crystallographic structure
rendering images (depicting crystal structure or topology), and
other gas sorption isotherms (relevant for applications and gas
uptake). Accordingly, these were established as label choices 1
through 6. It is noteworthy that a single page may contain
multiple plots (e.g., PXRD and TGA concurrently), which
requires GPT-4V's capability to perform an identication of
multiple formats of plots. Therefore, the primary task assigned
to GPT-4V involves identifying these specied elements within
the image of the whole page, complemented by a structured
response template. Furthermore, the craing of prompts
adhered to three guiding principles outlined in our previous
publication:10 (i) minimizing hallucination, (ii) implementing
detailed instructions, and (iii) ensuring structured output. The
complete prompt is available in ESI Fig. S15.†
Automation in paper reading
With the prompt nalized, GPT-4V's task was to “read” through
all the pages from selected papers. This was accomplished by
sequentially presenting each image of the whole page, along
with the designated prompt, to the model and collecting its
responses. This iterative process was automated using a for-
loop structure via simple python code generated with the
assistance of ChatGPT (ESI Fig. S17†). In particular, two options
exist, and both were tested in this study: (i) interfacing with the
web-based chatbot (ChatGPT powered by GPT-4V, version dated
September 25, 2023) and (ii) utilizing an API to connect with the
gpt-4-1106-vision-preview model. Both methods applied the
same underlying base model and were facilitated through
Python scripts capable of operating autonomously (Fig. S17 and
S18†). Additionally, the process for parsing and extracting the
labels from the responses given by GPT-4V was automated by
Python script (Fig. S19 and S20†).
Results and discussion
Initial assessment of GPT-4V's knowledge of reticular
chemistry
At the outset of this study, we rigorously evaluated the pro-
ciency of GPT-4V in recognizing and interpreting a range of
gures typically found in reticular chemistry literature by asking
GPT-4V to describe the respective gure sent along with the chat
(Fig.
S1–S14†).
This
knowledge
assessment
encompassed
various physical characterization plots including nitrogen
isotherms, PXRD patterns, TGA curves, NMR and IR spectra, as
well as illustrative plots such as scatter plots, bar plots, and 2D
or 3D molecular structures. In addition, synthesis schemes and
real experimental images, like microscope and SEM images,
were also analyzed. Each gure was presented to GPT-4V
alongside a brief prompt requesting a description of the input
gure in a conversational format.
The responses from GPT-4V (ESI Fig. S1–S14†) demonstrated
its remarkable capability to not only categorize these images
accurately but also to elaborate on specic details, including
notations, axis ranges, color coding and shape of symbols and
lines, labels, legends, and to draw inferences from the provided
information in the gure caption. This advanced level of
contextual data interpretation and holistic analysis underscores
the suitability of GPT-4V as a potent AI assistant for image and
data mining in scientic literature.
Designing prompts for page content labelling
The core objective of this study was to investigate whether GPT-
4V could automatically navigate through scientic papers,
identifying
specic
information
and
aggregating
it
into
a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our interest
specically centered on plots pivotal in the physical character-
ization of MOFs. These plots, namely nitrogen isotherms, PXRD
patterns, TGA curves, crystal structure or topology illustrations,
and other gas sorption isotherms, are instrumental in deducing
key properties of chemical compounds, including permanent
porosity, crystallinity, thermal stability, connectivity (topology),
and sorbent selectivity towards gases. Successfully extracting
and consolidating data from these plots amongst a vast volume
of literature holds immense potential for advancing our
understanding of structure–property relationships and in
accelerating the discovery of novel compounds.8,34,37,38,43–48
To this end, we designed a specic and extensive prompt for
GPT-4V, targeting the aforementioned categories (Fig. 1 and ESI

Fig. S15†). Unlike the brief prompts employed in the initial
assessment of GPT-4V's knowledge in reticular chemistry
(Fig. S1–S14†), the formal prompt used for image mining in this
study was developed by employing the prompt engineering
strategies that we previously reported,10,14 making it more
extensive and comprehensive (see Methods section and ESI
Fig. S15†). It is noteworthy that the prompt allowed for the
possibility of multiple selections on a single page, as it is
common for various plots to coexist in scientic literature.
Additionally, GPT-4V was instructed to indicate the absence of
these ve categories when applicable. Therefore, in total six
choices were provided for GPT-4V (Fig. 1). The development of
these prompts was guided by general principles for prompt
engineering in text mining.10
Performance evaluation of GPT-4V
In our workow, each page of the selected literature was digi-
tized into an image and then analyzed by GPT-4V (see Methods
section). This process involved combining each image with
a
textual
prompt,
aer
which
GPT-4V's
responses
were
collected. Particularly, GPT-4V was “programmed” by instruc-
tions using human daily conservational language in the prompt
to guide it to follow a specic response format (ESI Fig. S15†),
allowing for the automatic labeling of each page based on its
content. While copyright restrictions preclude the sharing of
the actual images used in this study, we provide four repre-
sentative examples that closely simulate the layout and content
of the analyzed pages from actual published literature49–53 to
illustrate this gure content identication process (Fig. 1).
These examples demonstrate GPT-4V's ability to accurately
recognize and label the desired plots on each page, regardless of
the complexity of the information shown. It is important to note
that in the actual evaluation, instead of using the four demo
images shown in Fig. 1, we used 6240 single-page images, akin
to “screenshots” that contain all the text and associated gures,
if any, in that page as a whole image, from 346 articles.
Consequently, the respective 6240 output answers from GPT-4V
were collected (ESI Data Set†). In other words, during each
interaction, each page was submitted separately in a new
instance of conversation to yield the classication result of the
given page. Essentially, GPT-4V could perform iterative classi-
cations of each page, utilizing the same prompt but varying
image content; this process was completed without human
intervention (ESI Fig. S17 and S18†).
The evaluation of GPT-4V's classication accuracy involved
comparing its responses against a benchmarking ground truth
dataset. This dataset was meticulously created by experts in
reticular chemistry, who manually reviewed and labeled all 6240
images for the presence of specic content (choices 1 to 6).
Performance metrics for each category were calculated indi-
vidually, considering the multiple-choice nature of the task (ESI
Data Set and Table S1†). For example, if the ground truth for an
image was labeled as “1, 3, 4” and GPT-4V's response was “1, 4,
5,” the classications for each category were assessed as follows:
nitrogen isotherm (Choice 1) received a True Positive, PXRD
pattern (Choice 2) a True Negative, TGA curve (Choice 3) a False
Negative, crystal category (Choice 4) a True Positive, other gas
sorption isotherm (Choice 5) a False Positive, and “none of the
above” (Choice 6) a True Negative.
The summarized metrics, including accuracy, precision,
recall and F1 score, are presented in Table 1. Notably, it displays
promising accuracy rates above 94% for all categories. This
indicates that GPT-4V can correctly classify a high percentage of
gure content across all 6 categories, which encompass 5
diﬀerent plots types and 1 NOTA category. Precision ranges
from 88% to 97% for ve of the plot types; however, it is notably
lower at 61% for the “other gas sorption isotherm” category.
This reduced precision is attributed to the category's broad
scope and occasional mislabeling of IR and NMR spectra as
such. This highlights an opportunity for further renement in
the content of prompts, aiming to enhance GPT-4V's under-
standing of the denition of gas sorption isotherm and
ensuring it does not mistakenly identify other spectra as
isotherm plots. The recall values, between 94% and 99% for all
six classes, suggest the model is eﬀective at capturing a high
percentage of gure content relevant to each specic class. The
F1 scores range from 93% to 95%, demonstrating a well-
balanced and robust performance in both precision and
recall. However, the “other gas sorption isotherm” is an excep-
tion with a 76% F1 score, which is foreseen due to its low recall
performance, indicating a certain limitation of the model in
this specic class, possibly due to insuﬃciently detailed
instruction in the prompt.
Additionally, similar accuracy rates were observed in GPT-
4V's performance via both the web user interface (WUI) and API
(Table S2†), a testament to the uniformity of the underlying
base model (gpt-4-1106-vision-preview). Here we acknowledge
that the base model is still in preview version, yet the obtained
results are very promising. The automated process for reading
papers and collecting output classications through both the
WUI and API oﬀers diverse operational choices with consis-
tently high performance. We note that in this study, no ne-
tuning strategies were applied, and the performance primarily
resulted from carefully craed text-based instructions aer
prompt engineering. This approach is becoming increasingly
important
in
the
realm
of
scientic
research
involving
LLMs.32,54–57 Impressively, we found that this also holds true for
multimodal models handling both text and graphical inputs
such as GPT-4V in this study.
Furthermore, the relation between the ground truth and
GPT-4V's classication output was visualized in a confusion

matrix (Fig. 2). Among the 6240 pages analyzed, GPT-4V iden-
tied
approximately
232
plots
that
were
with
nitrogen
isotherms, 630 that were PXRD patterns, and 331 that were TGA
traces. It suggests a substantial volume of data within the
analyzed literature. Moreover, 3537 pages were classied as
lacking the plots of interest, which can be a strategy to be
applied in the future to help human researchers streamline the
review process for a specic type of literature plot by excluding
less important pages and focusing only on the rest of the
content-rich pages. We also estimated the time of this auto-
mated literature processing approach (ESI Tables S3 and S4†).
On average, processing a 20-page paper took approximately 2
minutes at a rate of 5.5 seconds per image via API and this
process can be parallelized (ESI Table S3†).
GPT-4V's interpretation of nitrogen isotherm data
Building upon the successful labeling of page contents, we next
directed our focus towards utilizing GPT-4V for the detailed
interpretation
and
analysis
of
pages
featuring
nitrogen
isotherm plots. To achieve this, we rened our prompt strategy,
incorporating additional and specic verbal instructions (ESI
Fig. S15†). These enhanced prompts guided GPT-4V to not only
recognize nitrogen isotherms but also to extract and report key
descriptors from each plot. These descriptors included the
gure number, compound name, surface area or pore volume
value reported by the author, the presence of hysteresis in the
adsorption–desorption curve, the saturation plateaus of the
isotherm, and an estimation of a bounding box encompassing
the gure (Fig. 3). A critical aspect of this approach, aiming to
minimize hallucinations, was the instruction for GPT-4V to
strictly utilize the information available on the page image,
defaulting to answer “N/A” for any unobtainable or ambiguous
data. It turned out that GPT-4V demonstrated a remarkable
ability to extract these details by analyzing the isotherm, its
axes, legends, and accompanying text content.
To validate the accuracy of GPT-4V's nitrogen isotherm
analysis, we manually reviewed over 200 responses from pages
containing nitrogen isotherms in our selected papers (ESI† data
set). This evaluation was conducted for each of the six
descriptors independently. The results indicated high accuracy
levels for the gure number (96.67%), compound name
(90.42%), and porosity analysis (98.33%). We hypothesize that
GPT-4V's image processing capabilities, potentially incorpo-
rating optical character recognition (OCR) tools, played a pivotal
role in these tasks. Given GPT-4V's prociency with text, it likely
excelled in tasks where textual information was directly “read-
able” from the image. Conversely, the other three descriptors,
namely hysteresis presence, saturation plateaus, and bounding
box estimation, showed generally satisfactory performance,
ranging between 76.25% and 84.58%. These tasks, inherently
more challenging and nuanced, required a comprehensive
analysis of all image elements.58 Nonetheless, the overall
performance
was
impressive,
especially
considering
the
simplicity with which researchers could instruct GPT-4V using
natural language.
Accelerating the creation of digital datasets in reticular
chemistry
Our study further demonstrates the potential of GPT-4V in
accelerating the digitalization of experimental data for reticular
compounds. This is particularly evident from the sorption
measurement outcomes gleaned from community-published
literature. Once pages featuring nitrogen isotherm plots are
identied, each corresponding curve, typically presented in
a non-digital format (e.g., scanned or plotted images), can be
meticulously extracted using data extraction tools like Web-
PlotDigitizer.59 The extracted data points are then systematically
compiled and stored (ESI Data Set†). While we currently make
all mined sorption data available in a spreadsheet dataset
format, it is feasible that digitalized data can be converted into
AIF les as a rst step toward building the MOF sorption data
library.60 Fig. 4a presents a collection of nitrogen isotherm data
points manually extracted from the qualied pages in our study
as a proof-of-concept, showcasing a diverse array of isotherm
types and porosity characteristics. Leveraging the CoRE MOF
Database,36,42
which
provides
computational
results
for
compounds discussed in these papers, we matched each
adsorption–desorption curve's corresponding compound with
their CCDC number, accessible surface area, and pore volume.
This enabled us to visualize and compare the experimental
porosity (indicated by the nitrogen isotherm curves) with the
calculated values (derived from the CoRE MOF Database). The

outputs. The numbers in the diagonal represent the number of each

results, illustrated in scatter plots (Fig. 4b and c), represent each
compound as a data point, where the x-axis denotes the theo-
retical values calculated from CCDC CIF structures,36,42 and the
y-axis represents the experimentally reported surface area or
pore volume inferred from the extracted isotherm obtained
from the graphs identied by GPT-4V. The distributions of x
and y values of the data points are shown in the respective bar
charts. It is crucial to note that our focus was more on the
general trends across MOF compounds selected for this study
rather than on pinpointing the exact surface area and porosity
for each compound, as variations may arise due to diﬀerences
in calculation models and assumptions, and the re-digitalized
data points at very low relative pressures may decrease the
accuracy of the calculation.60–65
Interestingly, despite the use of experimentally determined
crystal structures in the CoRE MOF database,36,42 discrepancies
between
theoretical
predictions
and
actual
experimental
outcomes were observed. For instance, some compounds
exhibited a high theoretical porosity based on their rened
CCDC structures but failed to demonstrate such porosity
experimentally, possibly due to factors like structural collapse
during
activation,

environments,

suboptimal synthesis conditions. While variations of surface
area, porosity or measured isotherms may exist among diﬀerent
research groups and preparations,66 such a phenomenon does
not necessarily indicate a reproducibility issue, but rather
a failure to reach the full potential and optimal conditions of
the MOF in those studies. As a demonstration, Table 2 presents
eight representative examples illustrating these variances, with
some compounds showing excellent agreement between theo-
retical and experimental values (e.g., TAKCAM, OTIHOQ), while
others displayed certain deviations (e.g., BOHXED, TAKTAD,
and TOCJAY).
Our ndings reveal that reliance solely on computational
results for material selection can be sometimes misleading, as
many compounds exhibit experimental performances that
deviate substantially from theoretical predictions, even when
based on experimentally determined structures (Fig. 4). It
should be noted that these experimentally-determined non-
porous compounds are not necessarily useless, they in fact
serve as valuable negative data points in the mined nitrogen
isotherm dataset. By acknowledging these limitations and
combining computational methods with experimental data,
researchers can gain more comprehensive insights into retic-
ular
chemistry,
discern
trends,
and
make
informed
predictions.75–77 We envision that leveraging GPT-4V's capabil-
ities to search for more experimental data—not limited to
nitrogen isotherm but extending to other isotherms like water,
CO2 capture, methane sorption—and other critical plots like
TGA curves and PXRD from literature, in tandem with theoret-
ical insights and computational science, can signicantly
advance the discovery and development of high-performance
reticular
compounds
with
desirable
properties
and
functionalities.
To achieve this, it should be acknowledged that one limita-

Comprehensive analysis of nitrogen isotherm data extracted from selected reticular chemistry literature. (a) An overlay scatter plot of
distinct adsorption branches for nitrogen isotherms from 346 selected papers, exhibiting a range of uptake behaviors. The data points were
picked by WebPlotDigitizer using Automatic Extraction mode while the axes were aligned manually. The desorption branches are omitted for
clarity. (b) A plot correlating experimental and calculated surface area values, where each point represents one compound's data, linked via the
DOI number from the literature to the corresponding CCDC crystal structure in the CoRE MOF database. (c) A correlational plot for pore volume,
again with each point representing a single compound, illustrating the relationship between experimentally measured values and those
calculated based on crystallographic data. The color-coding in (b) and (c) indicates the percentage of experimental value reaching the theoretical
value. The horizontal bars along the top sides of the plots in (b) and (c) represent the histogram of the distribution of the calculated porosity
indicators, namely the surface area and the pore volume, reported in the CoRE MOF database. Similarly, the vertical bars along the right sides of
the two plots display the distribution of the experimentally determined porosity values re-digitized from the selected papers.

LLMs.78 Precision in prompt design is essential to achieve
specic and accurate results in desirable format, underscoring
the need for clear, detailed, and well-articulated instructions. In
addition, idiosyncratic and subtle prompt cues can inuence
the LLMs without changing the underlying meaning, and
consequently sometimes equivalent-looking prompts having
very diﬀerent quality.79,80 In this context, the emerging tool DSPy
(Declarative Self-Improving Python)81 represents a signicant
advancement as compared with human written prompts and
a future direction for this study. DSPy streamlines the process of
prompt creation, combining techniques for both prompting
and ne-tuning language models. Applying DSPy for prompt
optimization necessitates the existence of a relatively small
development set and some data annotation that DSPy will use to
conduct the optimization automatically. Conceptually, this
innovative system could enable researchers to commence their
inquiries with a basic scaﬀolding of the high-level steps of the
design and use DSPy to automate the instruction of LLMs,
which can be considered a solution to further strengthen our
workow and improve the performance of LLMs. In the near
future, we envision this combined approach can further
increase the accuracy of the tasks demonstrated in this study,
expand scope of the type of data to be mined from the literature,
and hold the promise of making advanced natural language
processing tools more accessible and adaptable to diverse
research scenarios.
Concluding remarks
This study demonstrated the application of GPT-4V in text,
image, and data mining within the realm of reticular chemistry.
Our ndings reveal that GPT-4V, when paired with carefully
constructed prompts, is capable of processing page images and
accurately identifying content in a fast and accurate manner.
This capability can further extend to isolating pages with
specic plots for in-depth analysis and building up datasets for
experimental measurements from the literature. Importantly,
the key features of LLMs like GPT-4V—being “programmable”
through everyday natural language and possessing pre-trained
domain knowledge—reduce traditional barriers associated
with coding expertise and model training for specic plot or
gure recognition. This adaptability is highlighted by the ease
of transitioning from analysing one type of data, such as TGA
curves, to another, like water isotherms, simply by modifying
the instructional prompt. We envision that this workow can be
transferable and move beyond reticular chemistry to a broader
spectrum of scientic disciplines. Nevertheless, there are
certain limitations to consider. For instance, the model exhibits
reduced accuracy in more complex tasks like the interpretation
of graphs, indicating a need for further renement in prompt
engineering strategies. The lack of benchmarking datasets may
increase the diﬃculty in coming up with eﬀective prompts to
guide LLMs. On the other hand, we envision that to make the
instruction on GPT-4V more eﬀective, the integration of
advanced platform like DSPy into our workow in the future will
open new avenues in scientic data mining and points to
a future where AI becomes an integral, user-friendly tool in the
advancement of scientic knowledge.

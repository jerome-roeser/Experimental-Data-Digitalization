The integration of arti ﬁcial intelligence into scienti ﬁc research opens new avenues with the advent of GPT-
4V, a large language model equipped with vision capabilities. In this study, we demonstrate that GPT-4V,accessible through the ChatGPT web user interface or an API, o ﬀers promising possibilities in navigating
and mining complex data for metal –organic frameworks (MOFs) especially from graphical sources ( e.g.
sorption isotherms, powder X-ray di ﬀraction patterns, thermogravimetric analysis graphs, etc.). Our
approach involved an automated process of converting 346 scholarly articles into 6240 images, whichrepresents a benchmark dataset in this task, followed by deploying GPT-4V to categorize and analyzethese images using natural language prompts, which can be written by chemists or materials scientists
with minimal prior coding knowledge. This methodology enabled GPT-4V to accurately identify and
interpret key plots integral to MOF characterization, such as nitrogen isotherms, PXRD patterns, and TGAcurves, among others, with accuracy and recall above 93%. The model's pro ﬁciency in extracting critical
information from these plots not only underscores its capability in data mining but also highlights itspotential to aid in the digitalization of experimental data and the creation of datasets for reticularchemistry. In addition, the trends and values of nitrogen isotherm data from the selected literatureallowed for a comparison between theoretical and experimental porosity values for over 200compounds, highlighting certain discrepancies and underscoring the importance of integrating
computational and experimental data. This work highlights the potential of AI in accelerating scienti ﬁc
discovery by bridging the gap between computational tools and experimental research.
Introduction
The integration of arti cial intelligence (AI) with the chemical
sciences holds immense potential, and is accelerated by the rise
of large language models (LLMs).1–7These models have received
substantial attention for the fact that they can be intuitively“programmed ”or“taught ”using daily conversational language,
thereby assisting with diverse chemistry research tasks.
8–20It is
envisioned that the evolution from text-only to more dynamic,multi-modal LLMs will result in even more powerful andconvenient AI assistants across various applications.
5,21 –23
The recent introduction of GPT-4V, with ‘V’denoting its
vision capability, stands as a testament to this progress.21,24
Trained on a vast and varied collection of multi-modal data,
GPT-4V can process and respond to both textual and visualinputs.
24–27Its ability to interpret and analyze scienti c litera-
ture, especially in identifying valuable data within graphicalrepresentations, makes it more attractive than traditional text-only models in natural language processing (NLP).
10,28 –30These
novel capabilities allow researchers from diverse backgrounds,
including those with no specialized coding or computer vision
expertise, to harness the power of GPT-4V through customizedinstructions applicable to various areas.

reticular chemistry.34,35We demonstrate how GPT-4V can
seamlessly interpret and integrate complex data from bothtextual and graphical sources in the scienti c literature (Fig. 1).
This ability to extract and analyze critical information fromvarious gures and plots dramatically increases the model's
utility in data mining and information retrieval. In particular,distilling physical characterization results from graphical
content reported in papers can be pivotal in establishing the
collection of experimental data and guiding the discovery ofnew chemical compounds.

tional tools and cutting-edge chemical research.40,41
Methods
Data preparation
For this study, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6240 pages
from 346 scholarly articles published in 22 peer-reviewed jour-
nals among 5 di ﬀerent publishers discussing metal –organic
frameworks (MOFs) was meticulously curated from the CoREMOF Database (2019)
42to ensure the diversity of writing styles,
article formatting and page layout. The selection criteriafocused on excluding papers reporting structures with zeroaccessible surface areas and those without publicly availableDOI numbers. In this case, the criteria resulted in the selection
of 346 downloadable articles which met the speci ed require-
ments on the accessible surface area from the 9147 papers listedin the CoRE MOF database. The selected PDFs were trans-formed into PNG format utilizing a Python script developedwith the assistance of ChatGPT (ESI Fig. S16 †). This conversion
process included 4423 pages from the main text and 1817 pagesfrom the ESI of those chosen papers (ESI Data Set). †
Prompts and image mining considerations
We wrote instructions in natural language to guide GPT-4V for
image classi cation and analysis. The primary objective was to
enable GPT-4V to categorize each image with a label re ecting
its content. These labels were designed to represent the mostprevalent types of plots encountered in reticular chemistry,
encompassing essential data and values. Key plots include the
nitrogen adsorption –desorption isotherm (indicating porosity),
the PXRD pattern (illustrating crystallinity), the TGA curve(demonstrating thermal stability), crystallographic structurerendering images (depicting crystal structure or topology), andother gas sorption isotherms (relevant for applications and gasuptake). Accordingly, these were established as label choices 1through 6. It is noteworthy that a single page may contain
multiple plots ( e.g., PXRD and TGA concurrently), which
requires GPT-4V's capability to perform an identi cation of
multiple formats of plots. Therefore, the primary task assignedto GPT-4V involves identifying these speci ed elements within
the image of the whole page, complemented by a structuredresponse template. Furthermore, the cra ing of prompts
adhered to three guiding principles outlined in our previouspublication:
10(i) minimizing hallucination, (ii) implementing
detailed instructions, and (iii) ensuring structured output. The
complete prompt is available in ESI Fig. S15. †
Automation in paper reading
With the prompt nalized, GPT-4V's task was to “read ”through
all the pages from selected papers. This was accomplished by
sequentially presenting each image of the whole page, alongwith the designated prompt, to the model and collecting itsresponses. This iterative process was automated using a for-loop structure viasimple python code generated with theassistance of ChatGPT (ESI Fig. S17 †). In particular, two options
exist, and both were tested in this study: (i) interfacing with the
web-based chatbot (ChatGPT powered by GPT-4V, version datedSeptember 25, 2023) and (ii) utilizing an API to connect with thegpt-4-1106-vision-preview model. Both methods applied the
same underlying base model and were facilitated throughPython scripts capable of operating autonomously (Fig. S17 andS18†). Additionally, the process for parsing and extracting the
labels from the responses given by GPT-4V was automated by
Python script (Fig. S19 and S20 †).
Results and discussion
Initial assessment of GPT-4V's knowledge of reticular
chemistry
At the outset of this study, we rigorously evaluated the pro -
ciency of GPT-4V in recognizing and interpreting a range ofgures typically found in reticular chemistry literature by asking
GPT-4V to describe the respective gure sent along with the chat
(Fig. S1 –S14†). This knowledge assessment encompassed
various physical characterization plots including nitrogenisotherms, PXRD patterns, TGA curves, NMR and IR spectra, aswell as illustrative plots such as scatter plots, bar plots, and 2D
or 3D molecular structures. In addition, synthesis schemes and
real experimental images, like microscope and SEM images,were also analyzed. Each gure was presented to GPT-4V
alongside a brief prompt requesting a description of the inputgure in a conversational format.
The responses from GPT-4V (ESI Fig. S1 –S14†) demonstrated
its remarkable capability to not only categorize these imagesaccurately but also to elaborate on speci c details, including
notations, axis ranges, color coding and shape of symbols and
lines, labels, legends, and to draw inferences from the providedinformation in the gure caption. This advanced level of
contextual data interpretation and holistic analysis underscoresthe suitability of GPT-4V as a potent AI assistant for image anddata mining in scienti c literature.
Designing prompts for page content labelling
The core objective of this study was to investigate whether GPT-
4V could automatically navigate through scienti c papers,
identifying speci c information and aggregating it into
a comprehensive dataset for further analysis. Our interest
specically centered on plots pivotal in the physical character-
ization of MOFs. These plots, namely nitrogen isotherms, PXRDpatterns, TGA curves, crystal structure or topology illustrations,and other gas sorption isotherms, are instrumental in deducingkey properties of chemical compounds, including permanentporosity, crystallinity, thermal stability, connectivity (topology),and sorbent selectivity towards gases. Successfully extractingand consolidating data from these plots amongst a vast volume
of literature holds immense potential for advancing our
understanding of structure –property relationships and in
accelerating the discovery of novel compounds.
8,34,37,38,43 –48
To this end, we designed a speci c and extensive prompt for
GPT-4V, targeting the aforementioned categories (Fig. 1 and ESI

assessment of GPT-4V's knowledge in reticular chemistry
(Fig. S1 –S14†), the formal prompt used for image mining in this
study was developed by employing the prompt engineeringstrategies that we previously reported,
10,14making it more
extensive and comprehensive (see Methods section and ESIFig. S15 †). It is noteworthy that the prompt allowed for the
possibility of multiple selections on a single page, as it iscommon for various plots to coexist in scienti c literature.
Additionally, GPT-4V was instructed to indicate the absence of
these ve categories when applicable. Therefore, in total six
choices were provided for GPT-4V (Fig. 1). The development ofthese prompts was guided by general principles for promptengineering in text mining.

Performance evaluation of GPT-4V
In our work ow, each page of the selected literature was digi-
tized into an image and then analyzed by GPT-4V (see Methodssection). This process involved combining each image witha textual prompt, a er which GPT-4V's responses were
collected. Particularly, GPT-4V was “programmed ”by instruc-
tions using human daily conservational language in the promptto guide it to follow a speci c response format (ESI Fig. S15 †),
allowing for the automatic labeling of each page based on itscontent. While copyright restrictions preclude the sharing ofthe actual images used in this study, we provide four repre-sentative examples that closely simulate the layout and contentof the analyzed pages from actual published literature
49–53to
illustrate this gure content identi cation process (Fig. 1).
These examples demonstrate GPT-4V's ability to accuratelyrecognize and label the desired plots on each page, regardless ofthe complexity of the information shown. It is important to notethat in the actual evaluation, instead of using the four demoimages shown in Fig. 1, we used 6240 single-page images, akinto“screenshots ”that contain all the text and associated gures,
if any, in that page as a whole image, from 346 articles.
Consequently, the respective 6240 output answers from GPT-4V
were collected (ESI Data Set †). In other words, during each
interaction, each page was submitted separately in a newinstance of conversation to yield the classi cation result of the
given page. Essentially, GPT-4V could perform iterative classi-cations of each page, utilizing the same prompt but varying
image content; this process was completed without humanintervention (ESI Fig. S17 and S18 †).
The evaluation of GPT-4V's classi cation accuracy involved
comparing its responses against a benchmarking ground truthdataset. This dataset was meticulously created by experts inreticular chemistry, who manually reviewed and labeled all 6240images for the presence of speci c content (choices 1 to 6).
Performance metrics for each category were calculated indi-vidually, considering the multiple-choice nature of the task (ESIData Set and Table S1 †). For example, if the ground truth for an
image was labeled as “1, 3, 4 ”and GPT-4V's response was “1, 4,
5,”the classi cations for each category were assessed as follows:
nitrogen isotherm (Choice 1) received a True Positive, PXRDpattern (Choice 2) a True Negative, TGA curve (Choice 3) a FalseNegative, crystal category (Choice 4) a True Positive, other gas
sorption isotherm (Choice 5) a False Positive, and “none of the
above ”(Choice 6) a True Negative.
The summarized metrics, including accuracy, precision,
recall and F1 score, are presented in Table 1. Notably, it displayspromising accuracy rates above 94% for all categories. Thisindicates that GPT-4V can correctly classify a high percentage ofgure content across all 6 categories, which encompass 5
diﬀerent plots types and 1 NOTA category. Precision ranges
from 88% to 97% for ve of the plot types; however, it is notably
lower at 61% for the “other gas sorption isotherm ”category.
This reduced precision is attributed to the category's broadscope and occasional mislabeling of IR and NMR spectra assuch. This highlights an opportunity for further re nement in
the content of prompts, aiming to enhance GPT-4V's under-standing of the de nition of gas sorption isotherm and
ensuring it does not mistakenly identify other spectra as
isotherm plots. The recall values, between 94% and 99% for all
six classes, suggest the model is e ﬀective at capturing a high
percentage of gure content relevant to each speci c class. The
F1 scores range from 93% to 95%, demonstrating a well-balanced and robust performance in both precision andrecall. However, the “other gas sorption isotherm ”is an excep-
tion with a 76% F1 score, which is foreseen due to its low recallperformance, indicating a certain limitation of the model in
this speci c class, possibly due to insu ﬃciently detailed
instruction in the prompt.
Additionally, similar accuracy rates were observed in GPT-
4V's performance viaboth the web user interface (WUI) and API
(Table S2 †), a testament to the uniformity of the underlying
base model ( gpt-4-1106-vision-preview ). Here we acknowledge
that the base model is still in preview version, yet the obtainedresults are very promising. The automated process for reading
papers and collecting output classi cations through both the
WUI and API o ﬀers diverse operational choices with consis-
tently high performance. We note that in this study, no ne-
tuning strategies were applied, and the performance primarilyresulted from carefully cra ed text-based instructions a er
prompt engineering. This approach is becoming increasinglyimportant in the realm of scienti c research involving
LLMs.
32,54 –57Impressively, we found that this also holds true for
multimodal models handling both text and graphical inputs
such as GPT-4V in this study.
Furthermore, the relation between the ground truth and
GPT-4V's classi cation output was visualized in a confusion

tied approximately 232 plots that were with nitrogen
isotherms, 630 that were PXRD patterns, and 331 that were TGAtraces. It suggests a substantial volume of data within theanalyzed literature. Moreover, 3537 pages were classi ed as
lacking the plots of interest, which can be a strategy to be
applied in the future to help human researchers streamline thereview process for a speci c type of literature plot by excluding
less important pages and focusing only on the rest of thecontent-rich pages. We also estimated the time of this auto-mated literature processing approach (ESI Tables S3 and S4 †).
On average, processing a 20-page paper took approximately 2minutes at a rate of 5.5 seconds per image viaAPI and this
process can be parallelized (ESI Table S3 †).
GPT-4V's interpretation of nitrogen isotherm data
Building upon the successful labeling of page contents, we next
directed our focus towards utilizing GPT-4V for the detailedinterpretation and analysis of pages featuring nitrogenisotherm plots. To achieve this, we re ned our prompt strategy,
incorporating additional and speci c verbal instructions (ESI
Fig. S15 †). These enhanced prompts guided GPT-4V to not only
recognize nitrogen isotherms but also to extract and report key
descriptors from each plot. These descriptors included thegure number, compound name, surface area or pore volume
value reported by the author, the presence of hysteresis in theadsorption –desorption curve, the saturation plateaus of the
isotherm, and an estimation of a bounding box encompassing
thegure (Fig. 3). A critical aspect of this approach, aiming to
minimize hallucinations, was the instruction for GPT-4V tostrictly utilize the information available on the page image,defaulting to answer “N/A”for any unobtainable or ambiguous
data. It turned out that GPT-4V demonstrated a remarkableability to extract these details by analyzing the isotherm, itsaxes, legends, and accompanying text content.
To validate the accuracy of GPT-4V's nitrogen isotherm
analysis, we manually reviewed over 200 responses from pagescontaining nitrogen isotherms in our selected papers (ESI †data
set). This evaluation was conducted for each of the sixdescriptors independently. The results indicated high accuracylevels for the gure number (96.67%), compound name
(90.42%), and porosity analysis (98.33%). We hypothesize thatGPT-4V's image processing capabilities, potentially incorpo-
rating optical character recognition (OCR) tools, played a pivotal
role in these tasks. Given GPT-4V's pro ciency with text, it likely
excelled in tasks where textual information was directly “read-
able ”from the image. Conversely, the other three descriptors,
namely hysteresis presence, saturation plateaus, and boundingbox estimation, showed generally satisfactory performance,ranging between 76.25% and 84.58%. These tasks, inherentlymore challenging and nuanced, required a comprehensive
analysis of all image elements.
58Nonetheless, the overall
performance was impressive, especially considering thesimplicity with which researchers could instruct GPT-4V usingnatural language.
Accelerating the creation of digital datasets in reticular
chemistry
Our study further demonstrates the potential of GPT-4V in
accelerating the digitalization of experimental data for reticularcompounds. This is particularly evident from the sorptionmeasurement outcomes gleaned from community-published
literature. Once pages featuring nitrogen isotherm plots are
identi ed, each corresponding curve, typically presented in
a non-digital format ( e.g., scanned or plotted images), can be
meticulously extracted using data extraction tools like Web-PlotDigitizer.
59The extracted data points are then systematically
compiled and stored (ESI Data Set †). While we currently make
all mined sorption data available in a spreadsheet datasetformat, it is feasible that digitalized data can be converted into
AIFles as a rst step toward building the MOF sorption data
library.
60Fig. 4a presents a collection of nitrogen isotherm data
points manually extracted from the quali ed pages in our study
as a proof-of-concept, showcasing a diverse array of isothermtypes and porosity characteristics. Leveraging the CoRE MOFDatabase,
36,42which provides computational results for
compounds discussed in these papers, we matched eachadsorption –desorption curve's corresponding compound with
their CCDC number, accessible surface area, and pore volume.
This enabled us to visualize and compare the experimentalporosity (indicated by the nitrogen isotherm curves) with thecalculated values (derived from the CoRE MOF Database). The

for each compound, as variations may arise due to di ﬀerencesin calculation models and assumptions, and the re-digitalized
data points at very low relative pressures may decrease the
accuracy of the calculation.

Interestingly, despite the use of experimentally determined
crystal structures in the CoRE MOF database,36,42discrepancies
between theoretical predictions and actual experimentaloutcomes were observed. For instance, some compoundsexhibited a high theoretical porosity based on their re ned
CCDC structures but failed to demonstrate such porosityexperimentally, possibly due to factors like structural collapse
during activation, inaccessible pore environments, or

area, porosity or measured isotherms may exist among di ﬀerent
research groups and preparations,66such a phenomenon does
not necessarily indicate a reproducibility issue, but rathera failure to reach the full potential and optimal conditions ofthe MOF in those studies. As a demonstration, Table 2 presentseight representative examples illustrating these variances, withsome compounds showing excellent agreement between theo-retical and experimental values ( e.g., TAKCAM, OTIHOQ), while
others displayed certain deviations ( e.g., BOHXED, TAKTAD,
and TOCJAY).
Ourndings reveal that reliance solely on computational
results for material selection can be sometimes misleading, asmany compounds exhibit experimental performances thatdeviate substantially from theoretical predictions, even whenbased on experimentally determined structures (Fig. 4). Itshould be noted that these experimentally-determined non-porous compounds are not necessarily useless, they in factserve as valuable negative data points in the mined nitrogen
isotherm dataset. By acknowledging these limitations and
combining computational methods with experimental data,
researchers can gain more comprehensive insights into retic-ular chemistry, discern trends, and make informedpredictions.
75–77We envision that leveraging GPT-4V's capabil-
ities to search for more experimental data —not limited to
nitrogen isotherm but extending to other isotherms like water,CO
2capture, methane sorption —and other critical plots like
TGA curves and PXRD from literature, in tandem with theoret-
ical insights and computational science, can signi cantly
advance the discovery and development of high-performancereticular compounds with desirable properties andfunctionalities.
To achieve this, it should be acknowledged that one limita-
tion of our work ow is that the e ﬃciency of using GPT-4V
hinges signi cantly on the skillful cra ing of prompts.

specic and accurate results in desirable format, underscoring
the need for clear, detailed, and well-articulated instructions. In
addition, idiosyncratic and subtle prompt cues can in uence
the LLMs without changing the underlying meaning, andconsequently sometimes equivalent-looking prompts havingvery diﬀerent quality.
79,80In this context, the emerging tool DSPy
(Declarative Self-Improving Python)81represents a signi cant
advancement as compared with human written prompts anda future direction for this study. DSPy streamlines the process ofprompt creation, combining techniques for both prompting
andne-tuning language models. Applying DSPy for prompt
optimization necessitates the existence of a relatively smalldevelopment set and some data annotation that DSPy will use toconduct the optimization automatically. Conceptually, thisinnovative system could enable researchers to commence theirinquiries with a basic sca ﬀolding of the high-level steps of the
design and use DSPy to automate the instruction of LLMs,which can be considered a solution to further strengthen our
workow and improve the performance of LLMs. In the near
future, we envision this combined approach can furtherincrease the accuracy of the tasks demonstrated in this study,expand scope of the type of data to be mined from the literature,and hold the promise of making advanced natural languageprocessing tools more accessible and adaptable to diverseresearch scenarios.
Concluding remarks
This study demonstrated the application of GPT-4V in text,image, and data mining within the realm of reticular chemistry.Ourndings reveal that GPT-4V, when paired with carefully
constructed prompts, is capable of processing page images andaccurately identifying content in a fast and accurate manner.This capability can further extend to isolating pages withspecic plots for in-depth analysis and building up datasets for
experimental measurements from the literature. Importantly,
the key features of LLMs like GPT-4V —being “programmable ”
through everyday natural language and possessing pre-traineddomain knowledge —reduce traditional barriers associated
with coding expertise and model training for speci c plot orgure recognition. This adaptability is highlighted by the ease
of transitioning from analysing one type of data, such as TGAcurves, to another, like water isotherms, simply by modifying
the instructional prompt. We envision that this work ow can be
transferable and move beyond reticular chemistry to a broaderspectrum of scienti c disciplines. Nevertheless, there are
certain limitations to consider. For instance, the model exhibitsreduced accuracy in more complex tasks like the interpretationof graphs, indicating a need for further re nement in prompt
engineering strategies. The lack of benchmarking datasets mayincrease the di ﬃculty in coming up with e ﬀective prompts to
guide LLMs. On the other hand, we envision that to make the
instruction on GPT-4V more e ﬀective, the integration of
advanced platform like DSPy into our work ow in the future will
open new avenues in scienti c data mining and points to
a future where AI becomes an integral, user-friendly tool in theadvancement of scienti c knowledge.
